Home server setup.


## Node Setup

Follow these steps to prepare the nodes you want to configure.

### Enable root ssh

1. Login to your server as root.
2. As the root user, edit the sshd_config file found in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

```sh
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

3. Add the following line to the file, you can add it anywhere but itâ€™s good practice to find the block about authentication and add it there. You can use `yes` instead of `prohibit-password` if you want to allow ssh'ing to the root user with a password instead of an ssh key.

```
PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
```

4. Save and exit the file.
5. Restart the SSH server:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

6. Create the authorized keys file at `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
7. Copy the contents of [ssh/authorized_keys](./ssh/authorized_keys) to the new authorized keys file on your server.
